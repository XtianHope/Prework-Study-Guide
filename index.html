        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>Every HTML element is like a box, and is sometimes referred to as the "CSS Box Model".</li>
            <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page.</li>
            <li>External CSS is the most common way to style a webpage. It is preferred because it allows the developer to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, making changes to design easier.</li>
            <li>Seperation of concerns is seperating code into different files based on how they will be used. "Each section of code should have its own responsibility".</li>
            <li>A selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules/declarations will apply.</li>
            <li>Declaration contains two important components : the CSS property we want to apply, and the value of the property.</li>
            <li>DRY code is used to greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a code base by grouping two or more elements that will share the same styling. This avoids repition and more lines of code.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
            <li>"*" Is a selector, also known as a wild card symbol, that applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
            <li>CSS are not automatically recognized by VS just because it resides in the same repository. We must use an HTML link element to connect them.</li>
