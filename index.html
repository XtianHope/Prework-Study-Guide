        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage. This element is required and crucial for SEO.</li>
          <li>SEO : Search Engine Optimization, is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing.</li>
          <li>The title tag is always displayed inside of the head.</li>
          <li>An anchor creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The anchor element is incomplete without an href attribute.</li>
          <li>The href attribute is a hyperlink reference.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The metal element defines metadata, such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Element refers to the entire element from opening to closing tag.</li>
          <li>Tag refers only to what appears inside the angled brackets.</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>Every HTML element is like a box, and is sometimes referred to as the "CSS Box Model".</li>
            <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page.</li>
            <li>External CSS is the most common way to style a webpage. It is preferred because it allows the developer to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, making changes to design easier.</li>
            <li>Seperation of concerns is seperating code into different files based on how they will be used. "Each section of code should have its own responsibility".</li>
            <li>A selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules/declarations will apply.</li>
            <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and linked documents.</li>
            <li>Declaration contains two important components : the CSS property we want to apply, and the value of the property.</li>
            <li>DRY code is used to greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a code base by grouping two or more elements that will share the same styling. This avoids repition and more lines of code.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
            <li>"*" Is a selector, also known as a wild card symbol, that applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
            <li>CSS are not automatically recognized by VS just because it resides in the same repository. We must use an HTML link element to connect them.</li>
            <li>Block assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
              <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
              <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>

              <li>A string is always surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
              <li>In JS we use the "var" keyword to give a variable a name. We also use an assignment operator "=" to assign the speicif cata that we want stored in our variable.</li>
              <li>In JS code, the lines of code end with a semi-colon.</li>
              <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. These do not automatically execute, you must call them. A functions name is always followed by parenthesis</li>
              <li>""===" Is a known as Strict Equality Operator. This checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a boolean result (true) if the values are equal or (false) if they are not equal.</li>
              <li>Commenting out code is a way to make a portion of code inactive without deleting it. You can do this by "/*" before the code and "*/" after the code you would like to comment out.</li>
